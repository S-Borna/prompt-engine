## Detailed Description

### What is PRAXIS?

PRAXIS instantly transforms your rough AI prompts into expert-crafted instructions that get you dramatically better results.

Stop getting mediocre AI responses. Start getting exactly what you need.

### The Problem

Most people write prompts like:
- "Help me with marketing"
- "Write some code for this"
- "Explain quantum physics"

These vague prompts lead to generic, unhelpful responses.

### The Solution

PRAXIS rewrites your prompt to include:
- ✦ **Expert role definition** — "You are a senior marketing strategist with 15 years of experience..."
- ✦ **Clear objectives** — Exactly what to deliver and in what format
- ✦ **Relevant context** — Background information the AI needs
- ✦ **Output specifications** — Structure, length, and format requirements
- ✦ **Constraints** — What to avoid and scope boundaries
- ✦ **Approach guidelines** — How to execute the task

### How It Works

1. **Write your prompt** in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok
2. **Click the Enhance button** (appears above the text field)
3. **Watch your prompt transform** into an expert-level instruction
4. **Get 10x better AI responses**
